**Project Overview**  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> This was one of my individual Master's project that focused on applying mathematical decision-making and data science concepts, particularly exploratory data analysis (EDA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The project analyzed the 2023 Sustainable Development Report dataset, which tracks global progress toward the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</span>
  
**Problem Statement**  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> With rapid global change and resource constraints, sustainable development has become crucial. The UNâ€™s SDGs aim to address environmental, economic, and social challenges by 2030. The project explores which countries are leading or lagging, the interrelations between goals, and overall progress trends. </span>
  
**Research & Analysis**  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> The dataset consists of 166 countries categorized by region, each assigned scores for 17 SDGs (0-100). The data quality was assessed, missing values were handled, and summary statistics were generated. Exploratory analysis involved visualizations such as boxplots and bar charts to compare SDG scores across regions and identify leading and lagging countries. </span>  

**Tools and Methodologies used**  
<span style="font-size: medium; color: blue;"> R, R studio, Exploratory Data analysis, Principal Component Analysis</span>  

**Project Goals**  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> 1. Analyze SDG progress across different countries and regions. </span>  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> 2. Identify factors contributing to high or low sustainability performance. </span>  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> 3. Use PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify key components influencing SDG scores.</span>  

**Ideation & Solution Exploration**
<span style="font-size: medium;"> 1. Boxplots revealed variations in SDG scores across regions. </span>  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> 2. Bar charts highlighted top (Finland, Norway, Denmark) and bottom (e.g., South Sudan) countries based on SDG progress. </span>  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> 3. Economic goals were analyzed to pinpoint disparities between top and bottom-performing nations. </span>  
<span style="font-size: medium;"> 4. PCA was performed to reduce 17 SDG variables to six principal components, retaining 83% of variance, aiding in pattern identification. </span>  

**Implementation & Outcome**
<span style="font-size: medium;"> The study identified which SDGs significantly differentiate high and low-performing countries. Below are the visualizations generated as part of the exploratory data analysis. For more details on this project, please click on the Github link at the top of this page.</span>
