<span style="font-size: medium;">The emergency department (ED) of a hospital is the most critical unit in the medical field. In a world of unpredictable endemics and pandemics, it is of utmost importance for EDs to have the best layout to treat patients effectively on time. Patient dissatisfaction and health-related potential risk situations in the ED are inevitable if the flow of patients through the various stages of medical treatment is not managed properly. Application of Lean methodologies, thus, has become significantly important in improving the effectiveness of ED operations. Using the concepts of Value Stream Mapping and Kaizen, ED processes can be improved to handle issues such as insufficient capacity or inefficient resource utilization.</span>  

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
<span style="font-size: medium;">Abeidi et al. (2018), through their study, collected real-life data on the length of stay of patients in the ED of a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. In addition, they interviewed healthcare professionals and management personnel at the hospital. Their study specifically concentrated on patients necessitating immediate intervention whose conditions had the potential to escalate into life-threatening situations (Level 2-3 patients, as per Triage classification). Using the data collected, they came up with the current state VSM of the ED and successfully developed a simulation model that closely mirrored the characteristics of the actual system. After analyzing the root causes of the value and non-value-added activities, and considering the areas of improvement, they successfully developed a prospective VSM for the ED process design. Implementation of this design could potentially decrease patients' length of stay from 86.14 to 60.15 minutes. However, their study did not identify potential bottlenecks within the ED system. Rather than overhauling the entire ED process, an alternative approach involved pinpointing specific processes that contributed to overall patient length of stay. Comprehending the underlying reasons for the prolonged duration of the bottleneck process and employing lean techniques to address them could also aid in establishing a streamlined flow for the entire ED.</span>
  
**OBJECTIVES**  
<span style="font-size: medium;">This project focuses on performing discrete event simulations using SIMIO software by creating a model as per the current state VSM layout from Abeidi et al. (2018), for Level 2-3 patients in the ED. After simulating the model for 300 hours, (which equals the length of Abeidi et al.’s (2018) study that was conducted for 2 months, between 11:30 AM to 4:00 PM), the different data parameters obtained were analyzed and the possible bottleneck process was identified. To deal with the said bottleneck, three different scenarios were considered. In the first scenario, the capacity of the medical staff was increased. In the second scenario, without considering the need for additional resources or capacity, the non-value-added activities were removed for all the processes. The third scenario was a combination of the first two scenarios - the staff capacity was increased for the bottleneck process and non-value-added time for the processes was not considered. The outcomes of these three scenarios were assessed for comparison, and optimal process parameters were proposed to enhance the ED's efficiency, specifically for Level 2-3 patients. Furthermore, recommendations were provided to explore various lean techniques that can be implemented in the ED, aimed at improving effectiveness in delivering services promptly and attentively.</span>  
  
**METHODS**  
<span style="font-size: medium;">The core principles of Lean thinking – understanding the specific needs and preferences of the patients, visualizing the flow of patients, information, and materials, creating a smooth and uninterrupted flow of patients, providing care and services based on actual patient demand, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement – can help in reducing different forms of wastes generated in the healthcare unit. Pure waste, such as procuring more medical supplies leading to excess inventory, long patient waiting times for appointments or test results, unnecessary movement of patients, staff, or medical equipments, and performing redundant tests on patients, do not add any value. Necessary waste, like scheduled maintenance of medical equipment or facilities to ensure their continued functionality and safety, maintaining safety buffers to handle unexpected surges in patient volume as well as implementing checks and verifications to reduce the risk of serious errors, also do not add direct value for the patients. However, they indirectly add value through the overall service delivered by the healthcare unit. To provide improvement initiatives for the ED environment, the methodology adopted in this study took into consideration the five principles of Lean toward increasing the value-added activities, minimizing the necessary non-value-added activities to an extent where a minimal number of resources are required, and eliminating the non-essential non-value-added activities.</span>  
  
<span style="font-size: medium;">SIMULATION-BASED VALUE STREAM MAPPING</span>  
<span style="font-size: medium;">Level 2-3 patients in the ED need to go through, roughly, the same processes for treatment. Hence, a VSM is essential to visualize the entire flow. On the other hand, simulation allows for a more comprehensive understanding, by considering the dynamic aspects and interactions within the system. This study incorporated the qualitative and visualizing method of VSM in conjunction with the quantitative analysis of simulation to identify the bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement in the ED. This approach also leaves open the possibility of assessing the potential impact of changes and identifying any unintended consequences, before implementing the proposed lean techniques for process modifications in the actual ED environment. A simulation model was thus created based on the current state of VSM available. The quantitative data obtained, after the model simulation, was used to conduct a thorough analysis of the average flow time, resource utilization, average waiting time in queue, and throughput of the different processes within the ED, to pinpoint and address the bottleneck.</span>  
  
**DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS**  
<span style="font-size: medium;">Data for this project was obtained from the research work conducted by Abeidi et al. (2018) in the ED of a hospital in Turkey. Through direct observation, they collected data about the time consumed by patients for different medical procedures within the ED. Based on their data, the cycle time, process time, value-added time (VAT), non-value-added time (NVAT), number of staff available for each process, as well as the commute time from one process to another were noted for this study. The below figure depicts the process flow chart for the Level 2-3 patients in the ED as per the study conducted by Abeidi et al. (2018).</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">SIMULATION MODEL DEVELOPMENT</span>  
<span style="font-size: medium;">In this project, a discrete event simulation model of the ED was constructed based on the available information related to patient flow and the current state VSM derived from Abeidi et al. (2018). The observation rooms, the ultrasound room, the X-ray room, the discharge process area as well as the entrance and exit to the ED were arranged such that the model depicted the actual flow of patients. Patient arrival pattern was exponentially distributed, as per the real data extracted for the ED. The Pert distribution was selected to calculate the processing times for the two observation rooms and the discharge process area; the distribution's minimum value was set equal to the value-added time, while the maximum value was set as the sum of both value and non-value-added time. The mode, or most likely value, was set to be the average of the minimum and maximum values. The processing times for the Ultrasound and X-ray rooms, which lacked non-value-added time, were fixed at 7.36 minutes and 4.29 minutes respectively. The below figure displays the value and non-value-added time for each process in the current state VSM, from Abidi et al.(2018).</span> 
![](/Code1_251.jpg)
<span style="font-size: medium;">The simulation model starts after a patient, arriving in the ED, is classified as Level 2-3 by the triage nurse, based on the urgency of his/her medical situation. The patient is then moved immediately to observation room 1, where his/her vitals are checked by the nurse. At the same time, a doctor starts with the diagnosis process. For accurate diagnosis, the patient is recommended to the Ultrasound and X-ray rooms, respectively. These imaging tests are crucial for life-saving interventions, as they swiftly provide detailed images of the parts of the body. After having completed these two tests, the patient is moved to observation room 2, where he/she receives the imaging test results. Based on the test results, the doctor determines the optimal treatment plan for the patient, along with the necessary medications. Upon receiving the final diagnosis or appropriate treatment, the patient is either referred to another hospital or discharged by the doctor. The patient or his/her family members move to the discharge area next to complete the process. The simulation of the model, for this study, ends at this stage. The below figure provides a snapshot of the simulation model that has been explained above.

<span style="font-size: medium;">SIMULATION RESULT ANALYSIS</span>  
<span style="font-size: medium;">After simulating the model for 300 hours, the produced result facilitated a comparison of the various ED processes. The average flow time in the system for patients came out to be 3.9 hours, with the maximum and minimum flow time being 8.7 hours and 1.02 hours respectively. This average flow time is equivalent to the length of stay of patients in the ED. Further, the values obtained for the first observation room differed greatly from the values obtained for the rest of the processes, with respect to the scheduled utilization percentage and the average input buffer holding time. With a fixed capacity of 2 for all, the scheduled utilization was 96.17% for the first observation room, 18.8% for the ultrasound room, 10.9% for the X-ray room, 33.26% for the second observation room, and 4.6% for the discharge process. Except for the first observation room, there was no waiting time at the other ED processes. Identification of the bottleneck process was, thus, very clear from the model results obtained – it was the first observation room, with an average waiting time in the queue of 2.81 hours and capacity being utilized to the maximum possible.</span>  
  
**REMOVAL OF BOTTLENECK**  
<span style="font-size: medium;">Long queues in the ED result in delays in receiving medical attention. To reduce the wait time of nearly 3 hours in the first observation room, the results of three scenarios were checked in SIMIO. In the first scenario, for the current state model, the fixed capacity of two was increased to four for the bottleneck process alone. This meant that two more additional medical staff were allocated to the first observation room, while for the other rooms, the number of medical staff remained the same. This simulation yielded a result that decreased the average flow time in the system to 1.19 hours as well as reduced the average input buffer holding time to 0.02 hours and scheduled utilization to 45.90% for the first observation room. In the second scenario, instead of increasing the number of resources for the bottleneck process alone, the non-value-added time associated with activities in the first and second observation rooms, as well as the discharge process, was eliminated. The processing time for each of these processes was adjusted to match the duration of the corresponding value-adding activities. No modifications were made to the processing times of the ultrasound and X-ray rooms, as there were no non-value-added activities identified for them. The average flow time in the system corresponding to this simulation was 1.10 hours, while the average input buffer holding time was 0.25 hours and the scheduled utilization was 72.18%. In the third scenario, the input parameters for the model remained consistent with those of the second scenario, and the sole modification involved increasing the medical staff capacity for the first observation room from two to four. The simulation outcome showed an additional decrease in the average flow time within the system to 0.85 hours. Significant reductions were also noted in the average input buffer holding time and scheduled utilization for the first observation room, with the former at 0.005 hours and the latter at 36.09%.</span>  

<span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, upon comparison, each of the above three scenarios significantly decreased the average flow time for patients in the ED, along with a notable reduction in the average waiting time in the queue for the first observation room. The application of these scenarios within the current state model—whether it involves augmenting the capacity of the first observation room, eliminating all non-value-added activities, or a combination of both—has the potential to enhance patient flow, service quality, and overall performance in the ED. Significantly, these changes can lead to a substantial reduction in the prolonged length of stay for patients in the ED. Below figures lists the model input parameters and provides the corresponding simulation result values, of the current state model as well as the three scenarios that have been considered to tackle the bottleneck.</span>

**LIMITATIONS**  
<span style="font-size: medium;">While this project was based on prior research work, it does have certain limitations. The simulation model was created under the assumption that it accurately represented the real-world system without significant statistical differences. The duration for patients to travel from the emergency entrance to the first observation room and from the discharge area to the ED exit was assumed to be zero due to the absence of real-world data. Consequently, for these two routes, connectors were utilized in the SIMIO model instead of time-paths. Additionally, this study was constrained by the absence of verification, validation, and the actual implementation of the optimal solution obtained from the three scenarios, to address the bottleneck issue in the Turkey hospital's ED. Implications related to the elimination of non-value-added activities across all ED processes and the financial consequences of increasing resources were not considered as well.</span>  
  
**CONCLUSION**  
<span style="font-size: medium;">The primary aim of this study was to identify and address the bottleneck within the ED system, with the goal of minimizing patients' length of stay. The management and staff of the ED can explore the three different scenarios proposed in this study, each demonstrating the potential to eliminate the bottleneck in the process. However, achieving the removal of all non-value-added activities in an ED setting can be quite challenging and often impractical. Emergencies, by their unpredictable nature, may necessitate certain non-value-added activities, such as quick assessments and triage classifications, which are vital in urgent care. In the real world, the second and third scenarios, despite providing optimal solutions in simulation results, may prove impractical. However, the first scenario, which considers non-value-added activities but focuses solely on increasing staff capacity, is more pragmatic and feasible for implementation. Through simulation, this proposed scenario has demonstrated the capability to reduce patients' waiting time in the ED by an average of 69.5%. The bottleneck issue is effectively addressed, leading to a remarkable 98.2% reduction in the average waiting time in the queue for the first observation room. Although the scheduled utilization falls to 45.90% due to the staff capacity being increased to 4, this capacity can be adjusted in the real world, based on patient volume, to avoid staff underutilization. The SIMIO results in this study have indicated underutilized capacity in the other ED processes, namely the ultrasound room, the x-ray room, the second observation room as well as the discharge process area. Lean techniques, such as cross-training, enable staff flexibility. Implementation of this lean concept will enable medical staff from the other ED processes to assist in the first observation room, as and when needed. This approach will ensure optimal waiting times in patient queues, reduce ED length of stay, and the proper utilization of resources, simultaneously.</span>   

<span style="font-size: medium;">An alternative approach involves reconfiguring the layout or arrangement of processes within the ED to accommodate different types of patients. This strategic adjustment can also address bottlenecks in processes, leading to a reduction in patients' length of stay and the overall improvement of flow. Experimenting with this approach through simulation can be considered as part of future research endeavors.</span>  

<span style="font-size: medium;">Eliminating bottlenecks represents just one of the various options available to the ED for enhancing process efficiency. By concurrently recognizing and minimizing waste, reducing non-value-added activities, instigating changes through continuous improvement initiatives, fostering staff awareness of Lean concepts, and prioritizing customer value, the ED can establish a seamless flow.</span>
